Pollution from heavy metals is the one of the most dangerous environmental concerns the world has been facing lately.
Human activities, such as mining, manufacturing plant operations, etc. can allow them access to the environment. Heavy
metals polluting soil can harm crops, change the food chain, and endanger human. Heavy metals thus, present in the soil
can be absorbed by plant tissues, enter the biosphere, and accumulate in the trophic levels of the food chain. Heavy metals
can also be disposed into water, pandangering aquatic life.
